# `mayumi`
A osu! beatmap request bot for Twitch streamers.

# Goal of this project
Competitor to Mikuia without all the extra features like leveling etc. Intended to be no bullshit, and possibly be easy to self-host in case shit *does* hit the fan at one point.

## Quick disclaimer
I don't have anything against Mikuia or Mikuia's developers, just thought it was lacking in some areas and a bit too much in others. I wanted to make something that could simply just work for myself and possibly other streamers that are interested in such a thing.

# Self-hosting guide
TBD. Maybe once I actually get it working myself on an official instance.
