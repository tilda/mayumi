# `mayumi`
A osu! beatmap request bot for Twitch streamers.

# Goal of this project
Competitor to Mikuia without all the extra features like leveling etc. Intended to be no bullshit, and possibly be easy to self-host.

# Non-goals of this project
- Mikuia-esque leveling. Too complex for my small brain.
- Custom commands. See ^.
- This could go on and on with basically everything Mikuia has because it's either very out of the scope of this project or too complex, lol

# (Possibly) planned features
- "Now playing" command, this will be complex though, and will require a client application.
  - If this is done, I also intend it to be self contained.

# Self-hosting guide
TBD. Maybe once I actually get it working myself on an official instance.
